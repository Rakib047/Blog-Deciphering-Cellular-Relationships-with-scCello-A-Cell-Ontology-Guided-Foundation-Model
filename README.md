# Blog Review: Deciphering Cellular Relationships with scCello

This is a review blog for the paper [**Deciphering Cellular Relationships with scCello**](https://openreview.net/forum?id=aeYNVtTo7o) published in 2024.

The paper introduces scCello, a cell ontology-guided foundation model that integrates single-cell RNA sequencing data with hierarchical cell type relationships to enhance biological understanding. By employing novel loss functions and ontology graphs, scCello excels in zero-shot classification, marker gene prediction, and drug response estimation. This approach significantly improves cell type generalization, disease modeling, and applications in precision medicine.
